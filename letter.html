          Mr. Tom Abraham<br>
          Night Court <br>
          Warner Bros. Inc.<br>
          
          <p>Dear Mr. Abraham: </p>
          
          <p>Thank you for your letter. I am sorry Night Court will not be taping during our visit in late October. </p>
          
          <p>The first show of the season aired here this week and I was horrified to see the so- called comic Gilbert Gottfried in the cast. What on earth is funny about screaming at everyone? I certainly won't watch the second part of this 2-parter without him being removed. </p>
          
          <p>Surely he did enough disgusting material on the recent awards show to justify him being banned from TV for life. He ruined your excellent show. I just don't understand how anyone could cast such a revolting performer in such a great show. </p>
          
          <p>Hopefully he will be out by the third show of the season. Then I may watch again. </p>
          
          <p>Sincerely, </p>
          <p>Charles Foster <br>

        <td><div style="padding-left:5px; ">He began performing stand-up as a teenager in 1971 at a Village club, on a Hootenanny night. Since that time, he has been a cast member of “Saturday Night Life,” in 1980-81, a cast member of “Thicke of the Night,” in 1983, and, this year, a featured comic on MTV and the subject of his own comedy special on Cinemax. His comedic talent is so prodigious, unique and compelling that, in addition to killing regular audiences during virtually every performance,his act consistently awe another comics on a nightly basis. George Calfa describes him as “probably the funniest person in the world. At one point he was so hot in this city… I've never heard laughs like he got- screams, where people were</div></td>

        moaning they couldn't take it. This is with audiences <em>and </em> comics.”
           
        <p>Calfa says, however, that Gilbert is determined to sabotage his act: “He must have fifteen hours of material, but whenever it gets to where people request it, he refuses to do it anymore, like his ‘Tony Del Vicho' character(an inane Brooklyn comic), who would say things like, ‘Why did the moron throw the clock out the window? Because he was a fuckin' moron!' But when people screamed, ‘Do Tony!' he stopped doing it.” One of the many unique qualities about Gilbert's act is its almost complete independence from the audience; he performs with his eyes shut or covered by his hands during the entire show- and yet, because of the overwhelming strength of his maternal and the sheer charisma of his character, the audience is virtually unaware of this. Calfa says that Gottfried has always performed this way, but in the past he made some effort to maintain a link with the audience by becoming a character called “Murray,” who “put on glasses and said to the audience after a sick joke,” You think that's funny? That's not a joke. A joke is, ‘Two Jews walk into a bar… That's a real joke.' Then he'd take off the glasses and say, ‘The pope loves rats- give the pope rats!' Then put on the glasses on again and say ‘Stop laughing at that sickness!” Calfa adds,” He's one of the only comics who refuses to give in, and yet he keeps getting offered TV shows and movies- people still want to use him, because he's so brilliant.” </p>
      <p>This “giving in” that Calfa speaks about is Gilbert's determination to do the opposite of what is expected of him. Paul Reiser says that before Gilbert completely refused to do his “Tony” character, he would do it, but stop in the middle if people clapped, and do something else instead. He fells that Gilbert has “an inability to be contained, patronized or told what to do, because he's afraid of finding out that the antiestablishment thing [stand- up] he's doing has now become yet another confinement.” Gilbert, on the other hand, says that he is not at all self- destructive and that he does not actively try to alienate the audience. He says, instead, that the reason he refuses to do characters like Tony in the showcase clubs is because he doesn't need to work on them anymore. He has established that they do well, so he uses his stage time to introduce new characters and bits. He says that those comics who continue to do the same pieces over and over, in order to get the guaranteed laugh, are actually the self- destructive ones, because they will never go beyond this. He adds, also, that in paying clubs he will do older characters like Tony, but in showcases, whose purpose is supposedly not to strictly entertain but to work on new material and characters (which is why the comics are paid so little), he chooses to work out. About his general reputation for neurosis, he says: “It's part of the package- if I wasn't like this, maybe I wouldn't be this kind of comic.” </p>
    Gilbert seems to be one of the few stand-ups who are able to completely transcend their need for audience approval, or at least to submerge it enough to concentrate only on the work itself and not be tempted by getting, or not getting, the maximum amount of laughs. Most comics, however, fall somewhere within Dreesen's two categories- those who want laughs, and those who need them. For comics who want approval, there is a constant temptation to go for the easy laugh and get the much- needed love fix whether it involves telling a dick joke or pandering to a sexist, racist or ultra- nationalist audience. For those who need approval, who need to feel that supreme blanket of love that comes from the constant laughter of a crowded club, stand up can begin to feel like a compulsion. Cathy Ladman says, “Sometimes I feel too attached to it. I wish I didn't. I do need it- it helps me validate myself.” For her, comedy is not a job, it's “a part of me, and I can't separate it…” </td>

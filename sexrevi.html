  <p>Gilbert Gottfried in bad taste? Never, not our Gil-boy. But those Janus- faced clowns at the Fox Network, who've built a modest broadcast empire in Kelly Bundy's buns, now seem to think that God's gift of masturbation is an evil plague that erupts in other people's homes and not those of their drooling, semi- comatose viewers. And that making jokes about it is even worse. </p>
  <p>When Gottfried chose to open the Emmy Awards broadcast with a droll defense of fellow short, loud comedian Pee-wee Herman's recent <em>contretemps </em> down Sarasota way, the very same executives who okayed such shows as <em>Babes, Get A Life </em>, and <em>In Living Color </em> turned piss yellow and pulled the sketch from the West Coast re-broadcast of the show, which was seen live in the East. </p>
  <p>“I want to get something out of my chest. I sleep a lot better since Pee-wee Herman has been arrested. Masturbation is a crime? I should be on death row,” brayed Gil to laughter and applause from the studio audience from the studio audience, which was made up of mostly television industry folk. </p>
  <p>Yet Television Academy president Leo Chaloukian, taking a dim view of the remarks, pulled the segment, harrumphing that, “It's not in keeping with out ethics. The Academy board was appalled.” </p>
  <p>The irrepressible Little Jew Who Could shot back, “Fox embarrassed themselves. I feel sad for the Academy, but the good thing is, I was the only funny thing at the Emmys.” </p>
You're killin' us, boy, you're killin' us. <br>

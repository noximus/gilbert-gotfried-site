  <p> <strong>Emmys sunk by Gottfried's poor taste</strong> </p>

  <p>What a shame that Gilbert Gottfried was permitted on the Emmy Awards Show. Some subjects are really not necessary, and this (masturbation) was one of them. How sad! I never saw Mr. Gottfried before, and I don't want to see him again. </p>

  <p>A comment was once made, quote “TV is the window of the world.” After watching the Emmy Award Show, I strongly suggest they pull the shades down. </p>
  <p>On a rating of 10, it just about earned a big 1. </p>

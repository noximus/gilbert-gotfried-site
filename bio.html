          <p>At the young age of 15, Gilbert Gottfried began doing stand-up at open mike nights in New York City.&nbsp; After a few short years, he became known around town as "the comedian's comedian".&nbsp; Other comics would run into the room whenever he took the stage.&nbsp; Saturday Night Live was aware of his reputation and in 1980, hired Gottfried as a cast member. </p>
          <p>It wasn't until a few years later when his true notoriety would begin.&nbsp; MTV hired him for a series of improvised and hilarious promos for the newly formed channel. This led to several television appearances on "The Cosby Show", "Late Night with David Letterman" and "Thicke of the Night".&nbsp; Although, the role he may be best known for was his improvised scene as Sidney Bernstein, the business manager, in "Beverly Hills Cop II". </p>
          <p>Aside from his glowing reputation in the clubs, he began to gain a reputation as the "king of quirky roles in both movies and television." He appeared in such movies as "Problem Child", "Problem Child II", "Look Who's Talking II" and "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane".&nbsp; He was also the host of the very popular late night movie series "USA Up All Night". </p>
          <p>After his stellar performance as the wise cracking parrot, IAGO, in the Disney classic "Aladdin", a new career emerged as a successful voice over talent.&nbsp; His signature voice can be heard in several commercials, cartoons and movies.&nbsp; He's the voice of DIGIT in the long running PBS Series "Cyberchase".&nbsp; Even more popular is his character as the angry and frustrated duck that finds himself in various comic situations trying to get one word across... "AFLAC!!!!!!" </p>
          <p>Recently, he was a regular on "Hollywood Squares". Currently, he's a frequent guest on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and "The Howard Stern Show".&nbsp; His true colors shine in the new documentary "The Aristocrats" (2005).&nbsp; "Out of the 101 comedians who appear on screen (including Robin Williams, Sarah Silverman, Eric Idle and Lewis Black), no one is funnier - or more disgusting - than ...Gilbert Gottfried..." - Entertainment Weekly. </p>
